/* Exercise 1:
Create a `Person` class with a constructor that accepts `name` and `age` as parameters and assigns them to the respective properties of the class.
Also, create a method `introduce` in the `Person` class that logs a message in the format: "Hello, my name is [name] and I am [age] years old."
The method should utilize the `this` keyword to refer to the instance's properties. 
*/

class Person {
    // Your code here

/* Test your implementation with the following snippet:
let person1 = new Person('John', 25);
person1.introduce(); // Should print: 'Hello, my name is John and I am 25 years old.'
