Building the HTML document

You are required to create an HTML document representing a blog post. Please structure your HTML as follows:

- A `<header>` containing:
  - An `<h1>` element for the blog title. Assign an id of `blogTitle`.
  - A `<p>` element for the author name. Assign an id of `authorName`.
  - A `<p>` element for the date of the post. Assign an id of `postDate`.

- A `<main>` containing:
  - Several `<p>` elements to represent the blog post content.

- A `<footer>` containing:
  - An `<h2>` element with the text "Comments".
  - A `<section>` for comments. Within this `<section>`, create three `<article>` elements. Each `<article>` represents a comment and should contain:
    - A `<h3>` element for the comment author's username. Assign a class of `commentUser`.
    - A `<p>` element for the comment content.

Remember, you will need to properly link your JavaScript file to your HTML file. Make sure to test your functions in the browser to ensure they're working as expected.
