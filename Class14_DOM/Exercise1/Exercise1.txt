**Exercise 1: Basic HTML Structure**

Prompt: 

For this exercise, you are to create a simple HTML document that includes a variety of elements. Your document should include the following:

- A title element with the text "My First HTML Document".
- A header element (`<h1>`) with the id "header" and the text "Welcome to My Website".
- Two paragraph elements (`<p>`), with the ids "paragraph1" and "paragraph2" and containing some sample text.
- An unordered list (`<ul>`) with the id "myList", containing three list items (`<li>`).

Your HTML should be properly formatted and indented. This exercise is designed to help you review how to create a basic HTML document and to understand how HTML structure corresponds to the DOM structure. 

(I could include some questions on DOM Trees. After creating the HTML Document create a dom tree in the below format)

-HTML
    -Element: head
        -Element: title
            -Text: My First HTML Document
    -Element: body
        -Element: h1   
            -Text: Welcome to MyWebsite
            -Attribute: id: 'header'
... etc etc
