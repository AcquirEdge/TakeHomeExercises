**Exercise 2: Nested Elements**

Prompt: 

In this exercise, you will build upon your knowledge of HTML elements to create a more complex structure. Specifically, you will practice nesting elements within other elements. Your HTML document should include the following:

- A `<div>` element with the id "myDiv".
- Inside this `<div>` element:
    - A header element (`<h1>`) with some sample text.
    - Two paragraph elements (`<p>`), each containing some sample text. 
    - In the second paragraph, include some text that is bolded using the `<b>` element. 

Remember to correctly nest and properly indent your HTML. This exercise will give you a better understanding of how the DOM tree is formed when elements are nested inside one another in an HTML document.
